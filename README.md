# Hermawan Monitora Worker
Hermawan-Monitora is a monitoring application, and the main feature is for monitoring services' health (more features will come), monitoring if services are down or up. It also can send email alerts if services are down or just up.

The Hermawan Monitora Worker is a part of Hermawan-Monitora applications, so it can't run independently.
